# DelaunayTriangulation
- Image morphing for given source and destination images.  
- Morphing uses triangulation algorithm called Delaunay triangulation.  Used divide and conquer approach for triangulation algorithm instead of iterative approach. This drastically reduces time-complexity.    
- Used OpenCV for morphing.
